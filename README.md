TASK 1 (Stock Price Predictions)
A stock price prediction project is an excellent starting point. It involves using historical stock market datasets, volatility indices, and fundamental indicators to forecast prices over the coming months. It's a valuable introduction to working with large datasets and prediction modeling. Begin by downloading a stock market dataset from sources like Quantopian or Quandl to kickstart the project.
